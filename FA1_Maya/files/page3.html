	<h1>Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir</h1>
	<hr>
	<ul>
		<li>The show is about two teenagers, Marinette and Adrien, who use the superpowers of magical creatures called kwamis and magical jewelry called miraculous to turn into Paris' saviors, Ladybug and Cat Noir, against the evil villain, Hawkmoth, who takes innocent people's negative emotions and turns them into his puppets.</li>
		<li>In every episode, we see how Marinette and Adrien try to balance school, life, love, and superhero-ing whilst having no one to confide in. They must wear a mask to hide who they truly are to protect themselves and their loved ones. But how long can all this stay balanced? and as their relationship progresses, how long will they be able to suppress the urge to see underneath the mask?</li>
		<li>As of September 2022, Miraculous is in its 5th season and we are expecting a 3rd episode soon.</li>
